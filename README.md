## 🛡️ SOC Homelab – Active Directory Monitoring with Wazuh SIEM

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates my Security Operations Center (SOC) homelab built to monitor an enterprise-style Active Directory environment using Wazuh SIEM.

The lab focuses on:

- Centralized log collection
- Identity-based threat detection
- Endpoint visibility
- Monitoring high availability services (DHCP failover)

This SOC environment is built on top of a separate Active Directory homelab, which serves as the infrastructure foundation.
